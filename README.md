# Gateway-JavaScript ðŸ’» 
Here's a perfectly broken solution to get someone's gateway IP with JavaScript, daym... it really do be like that tho

I have recently tried making a project in JavaScript and it seems like they don't really have a way, to give the Gateway IP of a client. Neither do I think they will, since it can be a security vulnerbility. *blink* *blink* (Joke's aside I am not really responsible for what y'all do!)
